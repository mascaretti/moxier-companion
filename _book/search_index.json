We will start from R, to then move to RStudio and, finally, the packages we are going to need. 2.1 Installing R Installing R has never been easier! You can simply follow the instructions you find in the video. install-R from RStudio, Inc. on Vimeo. An alternative is Microsoft R Open, which can be downloaded here. It lags behind the current R version, but it comes with better performance tweaks included. 2.2 Installing RStudio Once you have got R installing, simply follow this other video. Install RStudio from RStudio, Inc. on Vimeo. 2.3 Installing packages We now cover the installation of packages. Packages extend the amount of things you can do with R, from plotting to data analysis. We will be using the moxier package through this course, for instance. To quickly get up to speed as to how install packages, again, simply follow the video. Just, for the time being, skip the tidyverse installation. install Packages from RStudio, Inc. on Vimeo. 2.4 Installing moxier We are now ready to install moxier! First, we need to install an auxiliary package, the remotes package. This package allows to install other packages from GitHub. GitHub is a place where many people develop and publish open-source software. To install remotes, simply type in your console install.packages(&quot;remotes&quot;) Once the installation is complete, you can install moxier remotes::install_github(&quot;mascaretti/moxier&quot;) 2.5 Using moxier We are now interested in using moxier. What is inside it? To find out, we list the tutorials contained in the package.

Simply run learnr::run_tutorial(name = &quot;00-introduction-installing-r&quot;, package = &quot;moxier&quot;) Quite smooth, right? Of course, put the title you are interested in to run the respective tutorial. To see the full list, learnr::available_tutorials(package = &quot;moxier&quot;) Voil√†! You are ready to start learning!
