This book will help you get started and will guide you through the material of the course. The material of this course is based on the moxier package. It consists of a series of learnr notebooks, (???), that will guide through your first steps into the wonderful world of statistics and statistical computing! 1.1 Getting started Whilst we will dedicate Chapter 2 to the topic of software installation, we here introduce the main tools we will use throughout this course: R and RStudio. 1.1.1 R So, what do we talk about when we talk about R? According to the R project website, R is a software environment that includes: an effective data handling and storage facility, a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices, a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis, graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities. Quite a number of things! We will use this set of tools to dive deep into the principles of statistics and statistical computation. Another thing that is worth noticing is that R is Free Software. It means anybody can contribute to its development. Common tools have emerged to solve problems. R can be extended with such tools, which are called packages in R parlance, to do all sort of incredible things. Packages are usually stored on CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network, and they range from packages to send emails to machine learning. 1.1.2 RStudio RStudio is an R IDE (Integrated Development Environment). But what does it mean? Basically, it is a set of software that helps you be more productive: it allows you to quickly manage files, see what variables you have defined and a vast number of other things. This book and the moxier package have been developed from within RStudio. We will see in a minute how to install it! 1.2 Some useful links If you are interesting in learning more about R as a programming language, you can find many resources on the Internet. Some nice books are Hands-On Programming with R, (Grolemund 2014) to get started and Advanced R (Wickham 2019) to dive deep into the features of the language. 1.3 Licence The moxier package is subject to the GPL-3 licence.

We will start from R, to then move to RStudio and, finally, the packages we are going to need. 2.1 Installing R Installing R has never been easier! You can simply follow the instructions you find in the video. install-R from RStudio, Inc. on Vimeo. An alternative is Microsoft R Open, which can be downloaded here. It lags behind the current R version, but it comes with better performance tweaks included. 2.2 Installing RStudio Once you have got R installing, simply follow this other video. Install RStudio from RStudio, Inc. on Vimeo. 2.3 Installing packages We now cover the installation of packages. Packages extend the amount of things you can do with R, from plotting to data analysis. We will be using the moxier package through this course, for instance. To quickly get up to speed as to how install packages, again, simply follow the video. Just, for the time being, skip the tidyverse installation. install Packages from RStudio, Inc. on Vimeo. 2.4 Installing moxier We are now ready to install moxier! First, we need to install an auxiliary package, the remotes package. This package allows to install other packages from GitHub. GitHub is a place where many people develop and publish open-source software. To install remotes, simply type in your console install.packages(&quot;remotes&quot;) Once the installation is complete, you can install moxier remotes::install_github(&quot;mascaretti/moxier&quot;) Voil√†! You are ready to start learning! "],
